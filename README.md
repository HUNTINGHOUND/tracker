Stocktracker

Uses [Stockstracker](https://www.stockstracker.com) and [Yahoo Finance](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1) API to get realtime and historical stock prices. Use these prices for alert and analytical purposes. 
Currently only alert through email.

## TODO:
- [ ] add support for auto trading API of [Etrade](http://etrade.wallst.com)
- [ ] add some form of UI instead of just using the command prompt
